Fluent-ffmpeg is awesome. But for beginnners it's an overhead. If you just to transcode a video to mp4 use best practices for Resolution, Bitrate, FPS, etc AND use hardware acceleration without any knowledge about encoders like videotoolbox, cuda, etc. you can use this library. 

It's plain JS, so you can also use this ffmpeg command builder to use it in hypbrid environments like capacitor, cordoa, etx.
